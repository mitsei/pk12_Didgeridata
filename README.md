# pk12_Didgeridata
This module will guide students through a brief history and construction of a didgeridoo, the world’s oldest wind instrument, and a paixiao, a chinese pan ﬂute. Students will work with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and PVC-cutting tools to design and create a playable musical instrument. Using climate data trends from NASA Climate research source, students will compose a custom song related to climate data such as atmospheric CO2 concentration or global temperature anomalies. As an example of this, student may wish to use the Y axis of their example data as an analog of pitch, increasing the frequency of the didgeridoo or paixiao output over time. They may wish instead to vary the tempo of their composition, increasing the speed of their play over time. In this way, the soniﬁcation of climate data will be accomplished with a student musical chorus. The module will conclude with a group jam session with participants invited to provide percussion for the wind section.
